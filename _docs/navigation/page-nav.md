title: "In-Page nav"
---

The in-page nav (or page contents as it is sometimes called) is placed above main content of a page and provides navigation to individual anchor links located on the same page.

Useful on stand alone (no child pages) landing pages with lots of content. For example a course page or a campaign page.

Use at top of page before content and after h1 or banner. Include a maximum of eight links (this means you should limit your main page sections to eight also).

This nav becomes sticky on scroll.
