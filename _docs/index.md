The Wedgetail Design system provides:
* a framework for scalable, maintainable and iterative design and development of the UI of the La Trobe University web site.
* a collection of modular components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of pages/applications maintaining consistency of design and user experience.

## Why do we need a design system?

## Principles

### Atomic design

We use the [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) approach to create a modular design system.

### Responsive design

We use the Responsive Design approach to create a device agnostic solution.

### Iterative design

We iterate our design to optimise the User experience.

### Accessibility

The modular approach allows Accessibility to be achieved at the component level.

### Visual design principles

#### Vertical and horizontal rhythm

Vertical and horizontal rhythm is paramount for good UI design.

We achieve this through:
* Consistent spacing - using the soft grid approach where all spacing is based on 4px (in actually 0.25rem)
* Modular scale for heading hierachy - Major third

#### Readability

Readability is also paramount to UI design in particular web site design.

We achieve this through:
* Maintaining readable line lengths - https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation.html
* Typesetting
* Predominantly using black text on white background
* Using whitespace to allow easy focus an scanning of text requiring less cognitive load
