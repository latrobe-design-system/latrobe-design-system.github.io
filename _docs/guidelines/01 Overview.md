title: "Overview"
status: planned
info: Wedgetail is La Trobe University's design system for digital products and experiences. With the La Trobe Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources,  human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.
---

We use Wedgetail in our design/development process to design, develop and test new and updated UI components.
This design system also acts as the specification for CMS integrators and developers.

## Three Guiding Principles

### 1. Simple Build

This design system has been created to provide La Trobe University with a resource of living design patterns. The system aims to be cohesive, dynamic, reusable and maintable both in design and code.

### 2. Design for Flexibility

Using a design system ensures patterns adapt correctly to meet user needs, offering variation, and yet, providing design consistency and familiarity. It also allows us to build components that work well in multiple digital channels.

### 3. Reuseable Best Practices

Design, develop, test, review, and repurpose patterns, code, and design. That results in a comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect industry best practices.


## Status labels

The status scale is a way to indicate the level of robustness of any pattern in this style guide. New patterns should be released into the style guide following these rules, assess each pattern independently.

### Planned
- The user need has been identified, but the approach to solving the problem has not yet been decided.
- The team has decided to tackle this UI pattern.
- Pattern has been listed in the Roadmap.

### Draft
Includes everything from the Planned phase, as well as:

- Pattern is actively being defined. Use at risk, and with caution.
- Pattern may be generally usable for people with relatively “normal” digital literacy.
- Pattern is not approved for for use in production.
- Documentation may/may not be complete.

### Ready
Includes everything in the Planned and Draft phases, as well as:

- Pattern works in multiple configurations, and with other patterns in the Style Guide.
- Pattern is usable, on multiple devices/browsers.
- Pattern considers people with multiple disabilities (blind, low vision, cognitive disabilities, motor disabilities, low language skills, low digital literacy, etc.).
- Pattern has been reviewed by internal/external teams.
- The pattern has passed any heuristic assessments.
- Documentation is complete.

### Retired
- Pattern is no longer fit for purpose
- It should be removed from production, and will be removed from the Style Guide in due course.


## Getting Started

There are many ways to get started with the Wedgetail Design System. It all depends on your project's needs and whether you are a developer or a designer (or somewhere in between).

There are three ways to get started with the Design System;

1. Visit out Wedgetail repo on GitHub and clone to your machine
2. For designers, visit our download page to use design assets in sketch
3. For full page templates, download the design system starter kit

Once you have the components in a website we have advanced guides for developers on how to:

- Customise the colour scheme
- How to use the font size and space functions
- Customise existing components
- Create a new component
- Set up a development environment
- Spacing between components
- The advanced guides assume prior knowledge of npm and SASS.

Throughout the process you may notice issues, missing features or have ideas for new components. If you would like to contribute or help build the future of Wedgetail you can
