The main CSS file only makes use of it in 4 instances:

* Pull quotes.
* Intro paragraphs in news articles section - I couldn't find an example on the web.
* Attribution paragraphs in Profiles section - I couldn't find an example on the web.
* First paragraph in cross promo  - I couldn't find an example on the web.

__!!!AJP!!! We should replace this with a system font - e.g. <span style="font-family: Georgia">Georgia</span> - the extra font download is not worth it for these four uses!__
