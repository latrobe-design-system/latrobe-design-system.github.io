Tags are used to display relevant categories or set filters. 
{: .intro}

Tags can be either text, link or button.

Tags should not be confused with [Badges](/patterns/badge.html).

Use text and link tags to display a category, e.g. a news items category. Use text (span) when you only want to display the category. Use link (a) when you want to show the category and provide a link to the category listing.

Text tags (span) can also be used to display a set filter, search term or other setting – when you only want to display them.

Use button tags to to display a set filter, search term or other setting when you want to use it as a means of removing the setting.
