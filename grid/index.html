<p>Alignment is an important fundamental of design.<p>
<p>Graphic and UI designers utilise a grid to achieve pleasing designs with well connected content and consisent vertical and horizontal rythm or spacing.<p>
<p>Our typography vertical spacing is based on 4px increments.</p>
<p>By adopting 4px increments for all vertical and horizontal spacings we can achieve a well aligned harmonious UI without working to a hard grid.</p>
<p class="sg-rule">All spacing on the site is to be in 4px increments: font-size, line-height, margins, padding</p>
