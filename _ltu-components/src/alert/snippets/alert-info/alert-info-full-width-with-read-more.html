            <p>The world is transforming, and so are we.</p><p>For&nbsp;<strong>international students</strong> we’ve launched a new term structure. From July, these terms will commence every six weeks, so international students can begin studying&nbsp;online now and be ready to join us on campus once borders reopen. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/international/international-terms">enrolment and eligible courses</a>.</p><p>For&nbsp;<strong>domestic students</strong>, application for Semester 2 is open now. As the COVID-19 response evolves, the courses we offer, and how we offer them, may need to adapt.&nbsp;We now have <a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/study/apply/terms">more start dates</a> than ever.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/study/one-on-one-consultations">Book a consultation</a>,&nbsp;or call us if anything is unclear and we’ll be happy to help.</p><p>As the COVID-19 situation evolves, the courses we offer, and how we offer them will need to adapt. We continue to implement a COVID-Safe process that is guided by the Victorian Government. While we are working towards a gradual return to face-to-face activity at our campuses, we expect most learning activity will continue to be delivered online for the remainder of this year.</p>
