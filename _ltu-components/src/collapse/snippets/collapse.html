        <p>In response to COVID-19, La Trobe University is closely following the advice of State and Federal health authorities.</p>
        <p>As the situation evolves, the courses we offer, and how we offer them, may need to adapt. For example, how we deliver some courses might change from face-to-face to online for a while; academic start dates and subject availabilities might be adjusted for some courses to ensure that students can progress; and access to work-integrated learning opportunities such as clinical placements might be limited for a period of time. However, our aim is to always provide an excellent learning experience and outcomes for our students.</p>
        <p>We will make our best efforts to limit disruption and to inform future students as soon as possible if any changes are made to our current courses.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, please go ahead with your application now for our Semester 2 intake which is due to start on 20th July. Book a consultation or call us if anything is unclear and we’ll be happy to help.</p>
